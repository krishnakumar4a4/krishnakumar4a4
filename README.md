# Hi there, I am Krishna Kumar 👋

I work as an 🧑🏽‍💻 Application Developer 🧑🏽‍💻. On a daily basis, I work on multiple tech stacks and frameworks.  
Out of them I heavily work/ed with:

<br/>

Here are some of the other ones that I have known or worked:   
🌱 **Languages:** 🌱 Elixir, Dart for Flutter, Kotlin, NodeJS, VueJS  
🔭 **Frameworks:** 🔭 Flutter, React, Spring boot  
⚙️ **DevOps:** ⚙️ Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible  

👨‍💻 In my current role, I work as a Senior Consultant. Hence one of the primary expectation was to have an open mind to pick up any new language or framework based on the client needs. And I think I have matured my mindset enough to pick up a new language in a short stint. The same expectation also applies to picking up any new protocols, RFCs & technologies like Bluetooth, Crytography(encryptions, key derivation algorithms etc), Biometric devices, Http proxies, Websockets, NETCONF, YANG etc. 👨‍💻

✨ I like to convert these expectations to my personal learning opportunities (outside work hours) and along the way build applications for exploration, tools for productivity and sometimes products. All my open sourced works can be found here (and in `More about me` section below) ✨

## 🏋️‍♂️ What am I working on these days? 🏋️‍♂️
Since October'22. I am working with Bluetooth Low Energy to implement an efficient data transfer mechanism between mobile phones (IOS & Android). We have started with exploring Rust to have this layer written once and used on multiple platforms. However, Rust Bluetooth libraries for mobile platforms are not matured enough today. Hence we have moved implementation to Kotlin and Swift.
